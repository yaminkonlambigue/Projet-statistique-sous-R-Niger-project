# Projet-statistique-sous-R-Niger-project
This project is part of the R statistics project course, the main objective of which is data manipulation with R.
The aim of the project is to harmonize the databases resulting from household monitoring surveys following WFP interventions in Niger. Thus, 8 databases from 2018 to 2022 have been harmonized. Harmonization involved matching the variables concerned in the various databases to a set of standardized variables selected in order to obtain a global database while maintaining data consistency.
